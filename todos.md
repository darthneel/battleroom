- I want to refactor all things having to do with errors

- I want to come up with a solution for the erroring word_wrap in the method definition question: "Basically, you tried to use a method before you defined it, and Ruby said, "You haven't told me how to do that yet." To let Ruby know that
you're defining a method, you'll use the the "def" keyword, and end your method definition with the "end" keyword.
"

- I want to add follow up questions to variable assignment, to hammer home the idea that variables store a reference to an object in memory. Look for common language explanations.
  - Booleans make a great reassignment. Example: "Things have changed. reassign takes_baths (currently assigned to the boolean value of true) to false."
  - Fixnums and floats make for basic math questions
  - I have reservations about doing string concatention

- String concatenation questions
- String interpolation questions
- Collection Questions
- Nested Data Structure Questions

- I want to write tests for the the variable question data.

- I want to standardize the spacing across all question prompts and congratulations
  - The congratulation in data structure access questions appears on the very next line. Perhaps it should be given some extra space.
  - The error appears on the very next line as well. Add a new line after
