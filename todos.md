I have to tackle a bug that allows users to use their terminal using backticks

I need to handle cases where users enter unterminated strings, ie home[:city] = 'South Eduardo
...and nothing happens in the data structure assignment questions

I want to add software to the data_structure access and assignment

I want to add assigning values to a particular index value within an array

I want to add a DefiningMethodQuestion model

# I want to add a check for when a student adds a value to a hash, but to the wrong key. I can check this by looking at the size of the Hash#keys array.

# I want to make sure the line of the terminal wraps so that words aren't broken up, slash truncated
