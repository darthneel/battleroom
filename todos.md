## Todos

- I want to refactor all things having to do with errors

- I want to come up with a solution for the erroring word_wrap in the method definition question: "Basically, you tried to use a method before you defined it, and Ruby said, "You haven't told me how to do that yet." To let Ruby know that
you're defining a method, you'll use the the "def" keyword, and end your method definition with the "end" keyword.
"

- I want to add follow up questions to variable assignment, to hammer home the idea that variables store a reference to an object in memory. Look for common language explanations.

- I want to write tests for the the variable question data.

- I want to quiet the congratulation on DataStructureAssignment questions
