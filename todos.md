- I have to tackle a bug that allows users to use their terminal using backticks, or 'require', or 'binding.pry'

- I want to add assigning values to a particular index value within an array

- I want to add a DefiningMethodQuestion model

- I want to make sure the line of the terminal wraps so that words aren't broken up, slash truncated
