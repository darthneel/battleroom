- I want to consolidate some of the data, because there are repeats in the data structure access and assignment data files.

- I want to consolidate the logic from DSAccess and DSAssignment Questions into their shared superclass, DSQ.


- I want to cull down some of the user hashes in data structure access. Right now they're as big as they can be, which makes them identical in size. I at least need some variance between the size of the user hashes so that they don't seem repetitive and cheap.

- I want to add follow up questions to variable assignment


- I want to add assigning values to a particular index value within an array
  - Example: replace the string value 'Marp' with the string value 'darp'

- I want to add a DefiningMethodQuestion model

- I want to make sure the line of the terminal wraps so that words aren't broken up, slash truncated
