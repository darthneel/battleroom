## Todos

- I want to add additional advice to users who try to *invoke* methods with the parameters used in their method defintiion.

__Example:__ 
```ruby
def calc_area(x, y)
  x*y
end

# misguided invocation
calc_area(x,y)
```

- I want to add follow up questions to variable assignment, to hammer home the idea that variables store a reference to an object in memory. Look for common language explanations.
