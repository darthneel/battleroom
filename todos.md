## Todos

- I want to refactor all things having to do with errors

- I want to limit the length of business names, such that they're no longer than 15 characters

- I want to add follow up questions to variable assignment, to hammer home the idea that variables store a reference to an object in memory. Look for common language explanations.

- I want to standardize the spacing across all question prompts and congratulations
  - The congratulation in data structure access questions appears on the very next line. Perhaps it should be given some extra space.
