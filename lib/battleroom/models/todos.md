I need to handle cases where users enter unterminated strings, ie home[:city] = 'South Eduardo
and nothing happens in the data structure assignment questions

I want to add assigning values to a particular index value within an array

I want to add writing method definitions to battleroom

I want to leverage faker's address data for data access questions

# I want to handle simply incorrect user input for data_structure assignment questions
  - add a check for when a student adds a value to a hash, but to the wrong key. I can check this by looking at the size of the Hash#keys array.

# I want to make sure the line of the terminal wraps so that words aren't broken up, slash truncated
